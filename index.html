                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>With my experiences supporting small businesses, government and non-profits I am looking for opportunities to apply my developer skills to support projects and teams in making tools that will support small businesses, advance smart city technologies, and combat climate change.
                </p>
                <p>I like development because enjoy the creative process of problem-solving when addressing user needs and technological feasability. I decided to get into development because I realized I have always enjoyed building things, taking things apart, and putting them back together again. I was the kid in class who was always taking apart his pen and putting it back together again just to understand how it works.</p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not developing, I can be found hanging out with my wife & dog, listening to music from anywhere and anytime, being outside, climbing, biking, or enjoying the best bites NYC has to offer.
